# Resume-Speed-Reader

This utility helps the user to skim the resume quickly.
It consists of a spaCy based keyword extractor that displays the keywords on a pygame based UI.

Notes:
1. Keyword scrubbing module is pending to be added. Currenlty a lot of keywords not intended to the users are being displayed.
2. UI controls to be added. Currently the display speed can be only controlled by changing the code.
